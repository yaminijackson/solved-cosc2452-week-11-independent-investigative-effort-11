 <li>This week’s programming task will cover concepts required by Assignment 3. You should aim to get the help of your tutors and make further revisions.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Coding exercise steps (Hint: Need help? Ask your tutor via Canvas→Discussions→”IIE11″):</strong>

Complete the 08/Feb/2021 solution first as this extends upon that work. Next follow Canvas→ <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/modules">Modules→Week</a><a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/modules">  </a><a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/modules">10/11</a>  where the topic of writing to files is covered. <strong>Your tutors will provide further explanations on these general topics and how they relate to this IIE during their weekly “tutor chats”</strong>. Please also follow the announcement ‘<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1039805">How to debug large programs and get help on</a> <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1039805">debugging…</a>’

 <li>In this week’s IIE, you will modify <u>your own adaptation</u> of the IIE10 student manager (which has to be different to the student manager) to incorporate file writing using BufferedWriter+FileWriter in an appropriate manner and these approaches must work with both types of interfaces.</li>

 <li>Optional: Write a separate program to read values from a URL/web page in a manner similar to how we read values from a file (you will need to investigate this independently). Next, save the data to a file using the approach explained in Canvas→Modules for this week.</li>

</ol>

<em>[Side note: The concepts of packages, polymorphism, inheritance (parent-child/super class-sub class relationships), abstract classes, interfaces, etc. are not covered in Intro To Programming and therefore <u>must not be used</u> in assessments. Subsequent courses such as Programming 1, </em>

<em>Further Programming, etc. will cover these in detail.]</em>

<strong>Submission Checklist for Step 5:</strong>

<ol>

 <li>Ensure steps above have been followed in sequence.</li>

 <li>Ensure that there are no red dots (compilation errors) in your code. Code with red dots are not valid Java and cannot be marked.</li>

 <li>If you have not made a final submission for your Assignment 3, make a dummy submission for Assignment 3 by submitting <strong>your .java file to </strong><strong>Canvas→</strong><strong>Assignments→Assignment 3. </strong>Remember, you can overwrite this submission any time when you have a proper submission for your assignment.</li>

 <li>Take screenshots of the code, the running program and the data files and embed the <strong>screenshots in a post under </strong><strong>Canvas→</strong><strong>Discussions→Independent Investigative Exercise 11</strong>. If you are unable to embed screenshots, please follow the announcement ‘<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1038846">Having issues embedding images? Here’s the alternative…</a>’ The mark for this week’s work will be given based on this submission.</li>

 <li>Download your own file(s) from the discussion forum and ensure that it is correct. If it is not, you can edit/delete your post and retry.</li>
